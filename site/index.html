        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>
          The year was 2017. They met on OKCupid.
          Andrea sent the first message.
        </p>
        <img src="okc.jpg" />
        <p>
          Their first date was on a spooky halloween night. They met up for drinks and
          on a whim, Kevin invited Andrea to a nearby Halloween party.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kevin changed into a topical costume in poor taste.
          Surprisingly, this did not end the relationship.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fast-forward 2 years. Kevin made a ring...
        </p>
        <img src="ring.jpg" />
        <p>
          ...and Andrea said YES!

          In July of 2019, they moved to Los Angeles
          to start their lives together!

        <h2>The Wedding</h2>
        <p>
          Due to the health and safety of our families and friends, 
          Kevin and Andrea have made the decision to postpone 
          their wedding date to July 2, 2021. 
          Here are some important details:
        </p>
        <img src="love_1.jpg" />
        <p>
          The wedding will take place on <strong>July 3, 2020</strong> at
          <a href="https://paduaweddings.com/" target="_blank">Padua Hills Theater</a>
          in <strong>Claremont, CA</strong>.
        </p>
        <img src="venue.jpg" />
        <p>
          Guests may arrive at <strong>6:00PM</strong> and
          the ceremony will take place at exactly <strong>6:30PM</strong>.
          Following the cocktail hour, reception will begin at
          approximately <strong>7:00PM</strong> and will go
          until <strong>11:30PM.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>THERE WILL BE ABSOLUTELY NO
          PHONES ALLOWED DURING THE CEREMONY!</strong>
          We spent a lot of money hiring a photographer,
          so please allow him to take professional pictures!
          There is nothing more frustrating for a photographer
          than seeing a phone screen blocking the couple.
          You will of course be allowed to take photos and
          video during the reception, but if your phone is
          out during the ceremony, one of the staff members
          will kindly ask you to turn it off and put it away.
        </p>
        <p>
          All photography and videography is shot by
          <a href="http://deadboltphotos.com" target="_blank">
            Keeyahtay Lewis,
          </a>
          a long time friend of Andrea’s and extremely talented
          photographer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though our reception will have activities for friends and
          family of all ages, there will be both alcohol and
          cannabis bars for our guests that are <strong>over 21</strong>.
          The venue has stressed that if they find any underage
          drinkers and/or smokers, the entire reception will
          be called off. The venue also has the names and
          faces of those who are not of legal drinking or
          smoking age. We know you kiddos just want to join
          in on the fun, but the law is the law! Please do not
          ruin it for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worried about what you’re going to wear? No problem!
          Dress attire is formal, so please no jeans or sneakers.
          Andrea also requests that you do NOT wear white
          (she is a gemini and exudes Big Gemini Energy…
          please don’t make her upset...)
          Our wedding color is lavender;
          purple looks great on everyone!

        <h2>Travel Information</h2>
        <p>
          If you're flying from out of town, we suggest flying into
          LAX and renting a car. The venue is about 50 miles West.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ontario Airport is much closer to the venue,
          but can be less cost-effective. However, it is
          up to you to do your own research! Keep in mind
          if you are flying to and from LAX, you will
          have to either rent a car or take a cab to
          your hotel destination.
        </p>
        <img src="doubletree.jpg" />
        <p>
          There will be a block of discounted rooms reserved at
          the DoubleTree Claremont for $139 a night.
          Please call
          <strong>(909) 626-2411</strong>
          to book your room; use the code "GDW".
          We encourage guests to book early!
        </p>
        <p>
          There will be a shuttle bus between the DoubleTree and
          the venue at convenient times. (Schedule to come.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Uninterested in staying at a hotel?
          There are multiple beautiful AirBnB’s
          in Claremont! Claremont is a few miles
          away from the Angeles National Forest…
          there’s nothing more American than seeing a
          beautiful National Forest on the 4th of July!
        </p>
        <p>
          As previously stated, the venue is about an hour
          west of Los Angeles. If you are interested in
          staying in Los Angeles, we recommend staying in
          Culver City, West Hollywood, or Venice Beach.
